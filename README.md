## Thesis Abstract
The conventional method in hematology for detecting blood components is based on human inspection. This thesis proposes an automatic classification and detection system using a fuzzy inference system, which processes histogram peaks and spatial distances in microscopic images for enhanced accuracy and efficiency in hematology labs.

## MATLAB Scripts
- **color_marking.m**: Script used for applying color-based marking to processed images.
- **main_code.m**: The primary script that implements the fuzzy inference system for image analysis.

## Images
The `images/` directory contains all graphical data and figures referenced in the thesis. These are crucial for understanding the visual outcomes of the research.
